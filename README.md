# GLAB-370.2.1-Code-Mastermind

## Code Mastermind: The Great Organization Challenge!
In this activity, students will compete in a code organization challenge where they will put their skills to the test in organizing and structuring code.

## Getting Started
To get started with this activity, you'll need to do the following:

- [ ] Divide the students into groups of 3-4 members.
- [ ] Provide each group with a code file with poorly structured and unorganized code.
- [ ] Assign a task to the groups to create a solution for.
- [ ] Give the groups 30 minutes to restructure and organize the code according to PEP8 guidelines, naming conventions, indentation and spacing, comments and docstrings, and modular code principles.

## Sample Code

```
def square(x):
    return x**2

def cube(x):
    return x**3

def main():
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    squared_num = square(num)
    cubed_num = cube(num)
    print("The squared number is:", squared_num)
    print("The cubed number is:", cubed_num)

main()
```

## Usage
Once the groups have finished restructuring and organizing the code, have each group present their newly structured code and explain the changes they made. The class will vote on the best-organized code and award the winning team.
