# GLAB-370.1.3 The Dictionary Enigma

## Introduction
Welcome to GLAB-370.1.3! Prepare yourself for an exciting adventure into the realm of dictionaries in Python. In this lab, you'll embark on a journey through The Dictionary Enigma, where you'll unravel the secrets of dictionaries and wield their power in Python. Get ready to unlock the mysteries of Python dictionaries!

## Prerequisites
To fully enjoy this lab, you should have a basic understanding of Python syntax and be familiar with the concept of dictionaries and basic programming concepts.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enter the Realm of Dictionaries
As you step into this enchanting realm, you'll encounter the fascinating world of dictionaries. Brace yourself and prepare to unlock the power of Python dictionaries. Let's begin with a simple example:

```
# The Magical Library
library = {
    "Harry Potter": "J.K. Rowling",
    "The Lord of the Rings": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    "To Kill a Mockingbird": "Harper Lee"
}

print("Our magical library contains the following books:")
for book, author in library.items():
    print(f"{book} by {author}")

print("But wait! A new book has appeared!")
library["The Great Gatsby"] = "F. Scott Fitzgerald"

print("Now our library contains the following books:")
for book, author in library.items():
    print(f"{book} by {author}")

```
### Step 2: Embark on the Dictionary Enigma
To experience the magic of dictionaries, follow these steps:

- [ ] Open your favorite Python IDE or a text editor.
- [ ] Create a new Python file and give it an enigmatic name like "dictionary_enigma.py".
- [ ] Copy the code snippet from Step 1 into your file.
- [ ] Save the file and run it.

### Step 3: Unleash Your Dictionary Powers
Now it's time for you to unleash your own dictionary powers. Embark on the Dictionary Enigma and conquer coding challenges using Python dictionaries. Here are a few ideas to ignite your creativity:

**The Quest for Translation:** Create a program that acts as a translator. Use a dictionary to store words and their translations. Prompt the user to enter a word and display its translation if it exists in the dictionary.

**The Magic Inventory:** Design a game inventory system where each item has a name and quantity. Use a dictionary to store the items and their quantities. Allow the player to add, remove, and view items in their inventory.

**The Cryptic Encoder:** Write a program that encrypts a message using a simple substitution cipher. Use a dictionary to map each letter to its corresponding encrypted value. Decrypt the message using the reverse mapping.

Feel free to embrace these ideas or create your own intriguing dictionary quests. Unleash your dictionary powers, experiment, and conquer coding challenges!

### Step 4: Share Your Dictionary Enigma
Once you've conquered coding challenges with your dictionary powers, share your enigmatic creations with others. Showcase your code snippets to friends, colleagues, or even on coding platforms. Sharing not only spreads knowledge but also inspires fellow adventurers to embark on their own Dictionary Enigma.

## Conclusion
Congratulations on completing **The Dictionary Enigma!** You have mastered the art of dictionaries and harnessed their power to conquer coding challenges. Take these newfound dictionary powers and continue your journey into the vast realms of Python programming. The dictionary realm is full of mysteries and possibilitiesâ€”keep exploring, creating, and unraveling the secrets with your dictionary powers!
